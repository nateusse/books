# The goal

__Goal of software architecture__: Minimize the human resources required to build and maintain the required system

__Design quality__ Effort required to meet the needs of the custumer

__Good design__: Low effort that reminds like that in the lifetime of the system

__Bad design__: Effort that grows with new release

# Case study
Real company where:
- More ingeneers where hired
- Productivity didn't growth much
- Higher costs per release 

- __Problems:__
    - Little or null clean of the code
    - System put together in a hurry
    - Productivity relies in number of programmers
    - Effort put in managing the mess to add an insignificant feature
    - Money is not buying functionality

# Conclusion

- Overconfident to do clean architecture later is bad. Rush to market force to stay ahead, no time to fix mistakes
- Good code, clean, well-design matters
- Messy code __DON'T__ increase productivity first and slows developers later, is always bad. Bugs never sleep or relents
    - Jason Gorman experiment. Slowest TDD day was faster than faster non-TDD day. TDD was 10% faster.

- Start over from scratch the system and redesign is not good, overconfidence to believe this time will be different,  turns everything in a mess again
