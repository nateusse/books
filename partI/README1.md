# The promise of good test

## State of the union: writing better tests

- Testing protects against regression(bugs), it should fail
- Testing helps to think about the design, specifying behavior expected before code is written
- Automated test improves productivity, improve speed
- 100% coverage is not the goal, prioritize meaninful code
